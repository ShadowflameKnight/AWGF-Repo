This documents the order of which code goes in order to initialize a player's save. Kind of like pseudocode

1. Loading screen is replaced with the custom one.
2. Whenever a player is added, send a remote function called giveSlotAmount from the Data server script to MenuGUI client script.
3. MenuGUI will create however many slots giveSlotAmount told the player has. Starts at 1. In the future, bonus slots will be paid.
    a. When I mean looping, I mean it will send a remote function called fetchSlotInformation, which will fetch the slot information required to display for each slot in the main menu.
    b. This information includes name, gameplay time, or whether it is empty or not.
4. Slot buttons get functionality, including the ability to delete, rename, etc.
5. When clicked to enter a slot, activate gameStart local function, which activates a gameStartRemote, which gives relevant data to LobbyGUI, which has been put on :Wait() until it is given data from Data server script's remote function giveLobbyData
    a. Relevant data includes isEmpty and CompletedTutorial
        i. If it is empty, then engage in the process of creating a new slot. A modular function is used under LobbyInitializer
6. use startExpedition remote function to let GameplayServer know that the game is starting
    a. Will probably need to be renamed to something more appropriate like gamestart, but theres a lot of things called gamestart so that remains to be seen.
7. GameplayServer will get the profile of the user.
8. GameplayServer will plop the player wherever is appropriate given where they were last, including maps, lobby, tutorial, etc.
